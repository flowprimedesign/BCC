problems that i ran into

in 3a.
how to add operation from cin and use it in the program.






in 3b.






in 3d.

doubles are initialized with a random value, but i wanted them to start at 0 by default.
figure out how to initialize at 0.

had to figure out that each tax deduction bracket had to be unique and then added up at the end.
another problem was adding all the deductions at the end, but you can access some of the calculations
because of the conditional requirement of income. figured out to add all the deductions incrementally, 
but in each step separately so that each step had its own output.
